# House-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Developed an end-to-end machine learning model to predict residential property prices using industrial real-estate data. Performed comprehensive data preprocessing including handling missing values, outlier treatment, skewness reduction, feature encoding, and scaling. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key price-driving factors such as location, area (sq. ft.), number of rooms, bathrooms, floors, and construction year. Built and evaluated multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, with hyperparameter tuning to improve performance. Assessed models using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² metrics, achieving improved generalization and reduced overfitting. Implemented a reproducible ML pipeline for data preparation, training, and evaluation.
